# Arduino Sonar Machine
This project is based off of multiple DIY examples found online for a sonar machine.
I used an Arduino Uno, multiple two-way switches, a HC-SR04 ultrasonic detector, a SG90 servo motor, and a ST7735 LCD.
The LCD driver folder has been included along with the Arduino program itself.
